                <li><strong>Zip2</strong></li>
                 <ul>In 1995, Musk, his brother Kimbal, and Greg Kouri founded Zip2. Elon Musk provided them with $28,000 in funding.The company developed an Internet city guide with maps, directions, and yellow pages, and marketed it to newspapers. They worked at a small rented office in Palo Alto,Musk coding the website every night.Eventually, Zip2 obtained contracts with The New York Times and the Chicago Tribune. The brothers persuaded the board of directors to abandon a merger with CitySearch;however, Musk's attempts to become CEO were thwarted. Compaq acquired Zip2 for $307 million in cash in February 1999,and Musk received $22 million for his 7-percent share.</ul>

             <li><strong>X.com and PayPal</strong></li>
             <ul>
                In March 1999, Musk co-founded X.com, an online financial services and e-mail payment company, with US$10 million from the sale of Zip2. One year later, the company merged with Confinity, which had a money transfer service called PayPal. The merged company focused on the PayPal service and was renamed PayPal in 2001.

                <ul>
                    With US$100 million of his early fortune, Musk founded Space Exploration Technologies, or SpaceX, in June 2002. SpaceX develops and manufactures space launch vehicles with a focus on advancing the state of rocket technology.

            </strong></li>
            <ul>
                Is an American automaker and energy storage company co-founded by Elon Musk, Martin Eberhard, Marc Tarpenning, JB Straubel and Ian Wright, and is based in Palo Alto, California. The company specializes in electric cars, their powertrain components, and also produces battery charging equipment.

            <li><strong>SolarCity and Tesla Energy</strong></li>
            <ul>
                Musk provided the initial concept and financial capital for SolarCity, which his cousins Lyndon and Peter Rive founded in 2006.By 2013, SolarCity was the second largest provider of solar power systems in the United States. In 2014, Musk promoted the idea of SolarCity building an advanced production facility in Buffalo, New York, triple the size of the largest solar plant in the United States.Construction of the factory started in 2014 and was completed in 2017. It operated as a joint venture with Panasonic until early 2020.

            <li><strong>Neuralink</strong></li>
            <ul>
                In 2016, Musk co-founded Neuralink, a neurotechnology startup company, with an investment of $100 million.Neuralink aims to integrate the human brain with artificial intelligence (AI) by creating devices that are embedded in the brain to facilitate its merging with machines. Such technology could enhance memory or allow the devices to communicate with software.The company also hopes to develop devices with which to treat neurological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, dementia, and spinal cord injuries.

            <li><strong>The Boring Company</strong></li>
            <ul>
                In 2017, Musk founded the Boring Company to construct tunnels and revealed plans for specialized, underground, high-occupancy vehicles that could travel up to 150 miles per hour (240 km/h) and thus circumvent above-ground traffic in major cities.Early in 2017, the company began discussions with regulatory bodies and initiated construction of a 30-foot (9.1 m) wide, 50-foot (15 m) long, and 15-foot (4.6 m) deep "test trench" on the premises of SpaceX's offices, as that required no permits.The Los Angeles tunnel, less than two miles (3.2 km) in length, debuted to journalists in 2018. It used Tesla Model X's and was reported to be a rough ride while traveling at suboptimal speeds.

            <li><strong>Hyperloop</strong></li>
            <ul>
                On August 12, 2013, Musk unveiled a concept for a high-speed transportation system incorporating reduced-pressure tubes in which pressurized capsules ride on an air cushion driven by linear induction motors and air compressors. The mechanism for releasing the concept was an alpha-design document that, in addition to scoping out the technology, outlined a notional route where such a transport system might be built: between the Greater Los Angeles Area and the San Francisco Bay Area.

        <li><strong> OpenAI</strong></li>
        <ul>
            In 2015, Musk co-founded OpenAI, a not-for-profit artificial intelligence (AI) research company aiming to develop artificial general intelligence intended to be safe and beneficial to humanity.A particular focus of the company is to democratize artificial superintelligence systems, against governments and corporations.In 2018, Musk left the OpenAI board to avoid possible future conflicts with his role as CEO of Tesla as the latter company increasingly became involved in AI through Tesla Autopilot.Since then, OpenAI has made significant advances in machine learning, producing neural networks such as GPT-3 (producing human-like text),and DALL-E (generating digital images from natural language descriptions).
